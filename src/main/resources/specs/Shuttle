the Shuttle
===========

Since 1981, NASA space shuttles have been rocketing from the Florida coast into
Earth orbit. The five orbiters — Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and 
Endeavour — have flown more than 130 times, carrying over 350 people into space 
and travelling more than half a billion miles, more than enough to reach Jupiter. 


SPECIFICATIONS

First launch: 12-Apr-1981 
Number launches: 114 to end-2005 
Launch sites: KSC pads 39A/39B 
Principal uses: US manned capability to beyond 2010 (four reuseable Orbiter fleet), 25,000 kg payload delivery to LEO, satellite retrieval/in situ repair, short-duration science platform, Space Station assembly/servicing 
Vehicle success rate: 98.25% to end-2005 
Performance: 
LEO (204 km, 28.45o): 21,140 kg OV-102, 24,950 kg OV-103/104/105; each additional
1 km altitude reduces capacity by 25 kg, each crewmember beyond 5-person size 
reduces capacity by 230 kg into basic orbit 
LEO (204 km, 57o): 14,800 kg OV-102, 18,600 kg OV-103/104/105 (57o is usually the 
highest inclination flown from Florida, but dog-legging provides access to higher angles) 
LEO (204 km, 98o Sun-synchronous VAFB): 13,426 kg OV-103/104/105, assuming use if 
Advanced Solid Rocket Motors. Neither VAFB nor ASRM will be used 
Molniya (925 x 39,450 km, 63o): 3,563 kg using IUS via 222 km, 57o parking orbit 
Crossrange: 2,040 km max; 1,020-1,300 km used operationally by NASA
